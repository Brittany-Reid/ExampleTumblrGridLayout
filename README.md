# Tumblr-Masonry-ImagesLoaded-InfiniteScroll-Code
Backup of my JS implementation of Masonry and InfiniteScroll combined with ImagesLoaded for tumblr theme creation.

Uses Photoset Grid to handle quirks with tumblr's default way of handling photoset posts.

Will combine this HTML/CSS and document plugin versions etc at a later date to make this useful as an example.

If you stumbled here, the code here is just copy pasted from an old theme of mine. I provide no instructions or way of implementing it for your project right now.
