# Example Tumblr Grid Layout

This repository provides a template and tutorial for building grid layouts for tumblr themes using Masonry, imagesLoaded, Infinite Scroll and Photoset Grid.

## The Issue
The standard Masonry + imagesLoaded implementation doesn't play nice with tumblr's photoset post type. By default, photosets are iframes of varying layouts, however the images inside have the same loading issues as any other image. meaning they can throw off layouts if not loaded completely when layout happens. Unfortunately, imagesLoaded doesn't help us wait for them to finish.

## The Solution
