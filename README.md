# Tumblr-Masonry-ImagesLoaded-InfiniteScroll-Code
Backup of my JS implementation of Masonry and InfiniteScroll combined with ImagesLoaded for tumblr theme creation.

Uses Photoset Grid to handle quirks with tumblr's default way of handling photoset posts.

Will combine this HTML/CSS at a later date to create an example.
